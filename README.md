#Fav-Save!

##What It Does

Scrape specific links (my favorites) from an HTML page that was taken from a site and saved as a file.

##Why I Did It

I wanted to aggregate all of my favorite links from a site and save them into a file. I had multiple accounts on the site and as part of consolidating them I wanted to get all of the 'favorites' links from each account in one place.

##What It Was Like

A ton of fun, but mechanize was a little clunky to work with.
Thanks to a much larger, more intense project that I did with mechanize (closed source ), this only took about two hours, most of which was reading documentation and previous code that I wrote.

##Notes

Because I am almost sure this would go against the ToS for any modern site, I won't release the site that I used this on. I encourage the _study_ of webscrapers, but please be sure you aren't violating a site's ToS before writing one.
